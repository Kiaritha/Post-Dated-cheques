1.This app is meant to track post dated cheques for a company called Grebe enterprises.
   It is meant to keep track of upcoming cheques so that the organization can be updo date with them
     and deposit money to the respective accounts.The app also has fearures such as a reminder
     and a log in section where the user can key in their personal information.

2 I intend to add more features such as a clickable carousel that can help navigate to several pages.

3. The app mostly utilizes javascript and a React framework but also utilizes both CSS and HTML.
